However, child objects on `x` or `y` are copied over - if you to copy all values, you must pass `true` to the clone option.\n\n### options\n\n#### arrayMerge\n\nThe merge will also merge arrays and array values by default.  However, there are nigh-infinite valid ways to merge arrays, and you may want to supply your own.  You can do this by passing an `arrayMerge` function as an option.\n\n```js\nfunction concatMerge(destinationArray, sourceArray, mergeOptions) {\n\treturn destinationArray.concat(sourceArray)\n}\nmerge([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], { arrayMerge: concatMerge }) // => [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]\n```\n\n### clone\n\nDefaults to `false`.

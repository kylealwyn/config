Maintained port of the [Spacegray](http://kkga.github.io/spacegray) Light Sublime Text theme to Atom.

Note that this is not a _complete_ port, as I only coded the minimum amount of CSS to get the basic looks and feels. You should be able to customize further with your own stylesheet or other plugins on top of this.

## Why Yet Another Port?

Because the other port ([spacegray-light-ui](https://atom.io/themes/spacegray-light-ui)) is unmaintained and out of date (last commit was in 2013).

I tried asking the author to take over the repo but [the issue](https://github.com/aesarius/spacegray-light-ui/issues/6) goes unanswered.
